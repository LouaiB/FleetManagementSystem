# FleetManagementSystem
A web-app developed for real-time observation and management of delivery/transport vehicles.

The main functionalities allow a company/fleet supervisor to:
_Live track all their delivery/transport vehicles in real-time.

_View all their deliveries and designated routes.

_Assign new deliveries to a vehicle/driver (algorithmically calculates the best candidate, or allows you to choose which vehicle)

_Displays summaries/stats on each driver's performance, estimated fuel consumption, maintenance, etc.

An Android app is also bundled with this web-app which allows the drivers to view their required deliveries, get optimal routes, receive notifications on new deliveries, etc.

Technologies used:
Asp.Net Core
Entity Framework Core
MS SQL
Android Studio
HTML/CSS/JS

This is a project requested by Everteam and serves as my Senior Graduation Project for my Computer Science degree in the Lebanese University.
